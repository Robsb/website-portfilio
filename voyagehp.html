	<h2 class="h2">In this group project we had to come up with an idea for a game that would promote being environmentaly friendly, we came up with the game Voyage, in this group I was 1 of 2 designers.</h2>
	<h3 class="h3">In the game you have to traverse around different maps and environments to get to your end goal, you would do this by either using physical energy by walking or using a padle board, or you could use oil where you would use something like a car or jetski, the aim is to get to the finishing point trying to use as less fuel as you can.</h3>
